RL-derived policies are vulnerable to failures in environments characterized by dynamic variability. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a methodology involving the incorporation of an adaptive sliding mode controller into a pre-trained RL policy.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Grasp Force Optimization as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality Problem: A Deep Learning Approach","authors":"Hirakjyoti Basumatary, Daksh Adhar, Riddhiman Shaw, Shyamanta M.

The focus of this paper is to undertake a grasp analysis of biomimetic grasping in multi-fingered robotic hands as a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) problem. Our analysis is to solve it using a deep learning approach to make the algorithm efficiently generate force closure grasps with optimal grasp quality on untrained/unseen objects.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Bionic Reflex Control for Anthropomorphic Robotic Grasping exploiting Domain Randomization","authors":"Hirakjyoti Basumatary, Daksh Adhar, Atharva Shrawge, Prathamesh Kanbaskar, Shyamanta M.
