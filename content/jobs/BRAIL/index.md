The Biomimetic Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Lab, led by Dr. Shyamanta M. Hazarika, is a research laboratory at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, specializing in the development of neuroprostheses and intelligent assistive devices for robotic neurorehabilitation.

- Developed a testing framework on PyBullet and OpenAI Gym environment for training bionic hand grasp RL policies
- Formulated reward functions and experimented with algorithms like PPO, Soft Actor-Critic etc. to enable grasp-and-lift of deformable objects
- Applied domain randomization for Sim2Real transfer, achieving a 38% slip reduction and 14% decrease in deformation
- Increased stability with adaptive sliding mode control, improving slippage by 103.35% and deformation by 197%
