Built as part of the Robot Autonomy course at CMU, this project used a Franka Emika Panda arm with a stamping mechanism to autonomously generate pixel art. The system converts images into grid patterns, optimizes stamping order with Christofidesâ€™ algorithm to minimize travel, and uses force-controlled stamping with ArUco tagged ink pads for adaptability.
