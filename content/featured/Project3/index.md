Implemented a dual-camera sensor fusion system for hand tracking using Kalman filters, significantly improving joint angle estimation. Leveraged MediaPipe for accurate hand pose detection without camera calibration and integrated YOLO for real-time handâ€“object interaction tracking, evaluating performance with the Grasp Quality Index.
