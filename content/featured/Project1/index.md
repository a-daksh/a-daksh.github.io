The project aims to address the limitations of Total Knee Arthroplasty by integrating AR  with robot assisted manipulation, enhancing surgical visualization and procedural accuracy. The system provides functionality to overlay a surgical plan on the patientâ€™s anatomy using the Apple Vision Pro headset, while a KUKA LBR MED7 robotic arm executes surgical pin screwing tasks with sub-centimeter precision.
