 In this study, we introduce an innovative bionic reflex control pipeline, leveraging reinforcement learning; eliminating the need for human intervention during control design. Our proposed bionic reflex controller has been designed and tested on an anthropomorphic hand, manipulating deformable objects in the PyBullet physics simulator, incorporating domain randomization for enhanced Sim2Real transferability.
