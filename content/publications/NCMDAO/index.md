Grasp force synthesis is a non-convex optimization problem involving constraints that are bilinear. The focus of this paper is to undertake a grasp analysis of biomimetic grasping in multi-fingered robotic hands as a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) problem. Our analysis is to solve it using a deep learning approach to make the algorithm efficiently generate force closure grasps with optimal grasp quality on untrained/unseen objects.
