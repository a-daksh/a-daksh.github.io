 This study investigates the robustification of a reinforcement learning policy for implementing intelligent bionic reflex control, i.e., slip and deformation prevention of the grasped objects. RL-derived policies are vulnerable to failures in environments characterized by dynamic variability. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a methodology involving the incorporation of an adaptive sliding mode controller into a pre-trained RL policy.
