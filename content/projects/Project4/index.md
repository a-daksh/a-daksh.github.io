Developed a Raspberry Pi–based wearable to improve spatial hearing for individuals with hearing impairment. Designed a 4-microphone TDoA system that achieved 10° directional resolution, and integrated haptic motors to provide tactile feedback of sound direction. This reduced user response time by 30%, enabling faster localization of alarming sounds.
